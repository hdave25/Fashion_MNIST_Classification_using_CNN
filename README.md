# Fashion MNIST Image Classification using CNN
Classification of Fashion MNIST Images using different CNN architectures

**Fashion MNIST** is a dataset which consists of images of clothing. Each image is 28x28 grayscale image, with 10 different classes. The dataset contains **70000 images with 60000 for training and 10000 for testing.**
The Fashion-MNIST dataset is proposed as a more challenging replacement dataset for the MNIST dataset.

The mapping of all 0-9 integers to class labels is listed below : 

- 0: T-shirt/top 
- 1: Trouser
- 2: Pullover
- 3: Dress
- 4: Coat
- 5: Sandal
- 6: Shirt
- 7: Sneaker
- 8: Bag
- 9: Ankle boot

It is a more challenging classification problem than MNIST and top results are achieved by deep learning convolutional neural networks with a classification accuracy of about 90% to 95% on the hold out test dataset. In the code below an **accuracy of around 92% has been achieved** using many layers in Convolutional Neural Networks.
